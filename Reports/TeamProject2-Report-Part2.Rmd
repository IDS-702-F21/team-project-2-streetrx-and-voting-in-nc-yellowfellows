# Summary

# Introduction
The North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) is the body in charge of election administration as well as campaign money disclosure and compliance. They provide voter registration and turnout statistics online through the ncsbe.gov website, among other things.
For this study, we will attempt to identify/estimate how various groups voted in the 2020 elections, at least among those who registered, using the NC voter files for the general elections in November 2020. We also use the hierarchical model to focus on a few areas of interest. In the 2020 general election, how did various demographic groupings vote? If the general likelihood or odds of voting in 2020 change by county? What was the difference in turnout rates between males and females for the various party affiliations? and finally How did turnout rates fluctuate by age group for the various party affiliations?
